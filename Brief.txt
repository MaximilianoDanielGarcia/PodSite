Your challenge is to build out this early access landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

This challenge does include some JS, but it's only a small amount for the custom form validation.

Your users should be able to:

Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
The Email address field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"
View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
